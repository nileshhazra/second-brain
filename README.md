## A Record of Curiosity

This repository is the engine for a unique kind of blog: a **digital garden** where ideas are captured the moment they spark. The core philosophy is to eliminate the friction between thought and publication. Instead of a cumbersome process of cloning repos and writing markdown, new posts are created simply by opening a GitHub Issue.

> **The Problem:** Traditional blogging has too many steps. An idea in the shower is often lost by the time you're at your desk.
>
> **The Solution:** What if logging an idea was as easy as reporting a bug? This project makes that possible.

This system uses a GitHub Action to automatically convert new issues into formatted blog posts, which are then published as a static site via GitHub Pages. It's a living archive of learning, built for the speed of thought.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Frictionless Publishing:** Create a new blog post just by opening a GitHub Issue. No local setup needed.
* **Fully Automated:** A GitHub Action handles the conversion from issue to post, including front matter and tags.
* **Beautiful & Modern:** A clean, minimalist design with a focus on typography, light/dark modes, and a unique brand identity.
* **Open by Default:** Anyone can suggest a post by opening an issue, making it a collaborative knowledge base (with you as the curator).
* **Fast & Free Hosting:** Built on Jekyll and hosted for free on GitHub Pages.
* **Infinitely Forkable:** The entire system is open-source. Fork it and create your own digital garden in minutes.

## üöÄ Make It Your Own

You can create your own version of this digital garden. Here‚Äôs how:

1.  **Fork this Repository:**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to copy this project to your own GitHub account.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * In your forked repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
    * Under "Build and deployment," select **GitHub Actions** as the source. This is a new, more powerful way to deploy Pages.

3.  **Grant Permissions:**
    * Go to **Settings > Actions > General**.
    * Scroll down to "Workflow permissions" and select **"Read and write permissions"**. This is crucial for the Action to be able to create post files in your repository. Click **Save**.

4.  **Customize Your Site:**
    * Open the `_config.yml` file and change the `title`, `author`, and `description` to your own.
    * Replace the SVG logo and social links in `_layouts/default.html` to personalize your site.

5.  **Start Writing!**
    * Go to the **Issues** tab in your repository.
    * Click **"New Issue"**. The title will be your post's title, and the body will be the content.
    * Once you submit the issue, the GitHub Action will automatically create the post. It may take a minute or two to appear on your live site.
